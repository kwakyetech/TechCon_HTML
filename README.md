# 🎉 TechCon 2024 Website Project

Welcome to the **TechCon 2024 Website Project**!  
This project challenges you to design and build a complete, multi-page website for the **TechCon 2024** technology conference — using **only HTML**. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to create structured, accessible, and engaging web pages.

## 📌 Project Scope

Your website will include **five core webpages**, each with a unique purpose:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**  
   - The main landing page introducing **TechCon 2024** and providing clear navigation links to the other sections.

2. **About Page (`about.html`)**  
   - A deeper look into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.

3. **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)**  
   - A detailed event schedule presented in a clear, accessible table format.

4. **Register Page (`register.html`)**  
   - A user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the conference.

5. **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**  
   - Comprehensive contact information, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.

## 🧩 Concepts You’ll Practice

Throughout this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience with these core **HTML** topics:

- **HTML Structure:**  
  Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize your content.

- **Headings & Text Content:**  
  Apply heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and text formatting elements correctly.

- **Links & Navigation:**  
  Create internal links using `<a>` tags to connect pages and build a simple, functional navigation bar.

- **Tables:**  
  Design a readable table on the Schedule page to display sessions, times, and speakers.

- **Forms:**  
  Build accessible registration and contact forms using `<form>` and different input types (`text`, `email`, `password`, `checkbox`).

- **Images & Multimedia:**  
  Add relevant images with `<img>` and proper `alt` attributes. Embed a promotional video using `<video>` and integrate an interactive Google Map with `<iframe>`.
